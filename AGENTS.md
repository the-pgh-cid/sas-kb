# sas-kb contributor contract

This repository owns authored SAS migration knowledge and research. Runtime
implementations belong in sas-campaign; preserved upstream programs belong in
sas-ref; AWS deployment configuration belongs in its separate consumer.

- Read README.md, PROVENANCE.md, and NOTICE.md before editing.
- Preserve stable card IDs, citations, version scope, and evidence labels.
- Update collections.json when adding, moving, or changing card metadata.
- Label inference and distinguish proposed tests from executed receipts.
- Do not import internal working records or held-out evaluation answers.
- Do not copy third-party programs or change licensing as part of ordinary curation.
- Run python3 tools/check_catalog.py and git diff --check before publishing.
- Artifact style: no em dashes or ellipses; enforce mechanically.
